LACrimBook
===============

LACrimBook aims to replace West's big and expensive handbook of Louisiana 
criminal laws with a free, digital alternative.

This branch contains the version intended for desktop browsers, using an in-memory
data store (jlinq).  The main branch contains a version optimized for PhoneGap which 
uses web sql.

The project uses many open source tools including:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git)
* [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/)

View a working instance of this project [here](http://loyolalawtech.org/crimbook).

LACrimBook was created as a part of the [Technology and Legal Innovation](http://loyolalawtech.org) of 
[Loyola College of Law, New Orleans](http://law.loyno.edu).
